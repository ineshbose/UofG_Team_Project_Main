import django_tables2 as tables

from .models import Symptom

#The table should have a row for each person, and columns "id", "date" "lat", "long" and then one column per symptom. A person's
#answer to a symptom question should be shown in the appropriate symptom column. django-tables2 does not offer a straight-forward
#way of doing this. The module is based on generating columns from the *fields* of a model, and not the *instances* of a
#model. The workaround here is to override __init__ and add a new column per symptom there. This cannot be done in the
#main class because (I assume) it is not possible to modify self.base_columns there. This is not how django-tables2 is
#supposed to be used, but there does not seem to be a better solution.

class PersonTable(tables.Table):
    id = tables.Column()
    date = tables.Column()
    lat = tables.Column()
    long = tables.Column()
